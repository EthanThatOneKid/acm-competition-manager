> Last Updated: 9/14/2020 (Edits will appear at the bottom... ‚ú®)

Hello ACM club members! It's Ethan, your ACM Competition Manager.

Today I wanted to share some info with you about ShellHacks! üéâ

## Acceptances üôà

Firstly, I will address that despite the virtual event beginning on Sep 25th (about 10 days from now as of 9/14/20), I heard that they are going to release their acceptance notices "in the next couple days" and I am hoping that everyone who applied gets into ShellHacks.

## Learning Tracks üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The following list lists the learning tracks that ShellHacks will be offering. Think about which tracks you'll choose beforehand to give yourself the most productive/worthwhile experience.

- _Web Development_: Develop modern and responsive web applications using the latest technologies.
- _Mobile Development_: Build interactive mobile applications for the iOS and Android platforms.
- _Artificial Intelligence_: Implement machine learning algorithms to automate tasks and make predictions.
- _Game Development_: Create virtual experiences that bring characters and stories to life.
- _Information Technology_: Dive into cloud computing, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity.
- _Hardware_: Work with microcontrollers to tackle and solve real-world problems.
- _Design & Project Mgnt_: Create the ultimate user experience for your site or mobile app.

## Teams ü§ò

You can experience ShellHacks either as a lone wolf or as a team with up to 4 people. If you would like to be part of a team with some people here in ACM, I will personally pair you up with others looking to do the same thing; just message me and I will get on it. It is also an option to find teammates within the event itself if you choose to do so.
