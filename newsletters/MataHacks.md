> Last Updated: 10/27/2020 (Edits will appear throughout the document... ✨)

Hello ACM club members! It's Ethan, your ACM Competition Manager.

Today I wanted to share some info with you about MataHacks! 🎉
MataHacks 2020 is a 48-hour, virtual event, taking place on Zoom and Discord, in which students will be able to create their own products and present them to representatives of different industries.

## Registration 🙈

If you choose to register yourself for MataHacks, [**register here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdej0S5_38_FnW4D4F26U52kQ6ehE1NBvAh56QUeRl0XgEHkQ/viewform) (Google form) or register from their [homepage](https://matahacks.com/).
There is no explicit registration deadline, however MataHacks states: "Registrations will be evaluated on a rolling basis. Space fills up quickly, so apply early"!
If you are curious about when to expect to hear back about your registration status, MataHacks states: "We'll be releasing decisions weekly soon after the registration opens".

## Teams 🤘

You can experience MataHacks either as a lone wolf or as a team.
To register as a team, include your teammates' emails in the *anything else* question in the registration form.
MataHacks states: "We'll have a tool in the near future to get teams set up".

**Finding a team at MataHacks**:

> After entering and reading the rules on discord, you'll find the *#find-a-team* channel where you will be able to meet other participants and see the projects they are thinking of creating.
> If you have an idea, post it in the *#find-a-team* channel and if anyone wants to take part in it, they can reach out to you.
> Or if no one reaches out to you, you can join a team that you would like to work on.
> When you and a team are fully formed, the owner of the team can use the command `.createteam` to create a team with the bot `@MATAHACKS`, for example: `.createteam team name`.
> The bot will create a role with that name and a category consisting of a voice/text channel only that role can see.
> To invite others into your team, the owner can use the `.invite` command, for example: `.invite @user @user @user`.
> There is a max of 5 users that can be in a team.

## About MataHacks ⚙️
